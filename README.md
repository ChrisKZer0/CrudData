CrudData

In this project I worked with three Python data structures: lists, dictionaries, and tuples. 
Each one helped me understand a different way of storing and managing data.

Lists let me practice adding, removing, and updating items easily.
Dictionaries helped me organize information with keys and values, which made things like checking or changing a product’s price more direct.
Tuples showed me how fixed data works, and how to handle changes by creating new versions instead of editing them directly.

Using these three structures in separate exercises made their differences much clearer and helped me apply each one in a simple way.
